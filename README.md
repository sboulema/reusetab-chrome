# Reuse Localhost Tab Chrome Extension #

## Why? #

Opening external links causes a new tab to be opened, 
even if the host of the new URL matches that in your existing
tabs. This extension addresses that problem.

## Changelog ##

### 0.1.0 ###

* Initial version. Compares the host of new tab urls to the host of pinned tabs
  and opens the url in the pinned tab if they match.
